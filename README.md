## To run locally:

  Requirements: Flask, Python 3.6
  
  To run: flask run, click on link displayed
  
## Main features:
  
  * Signup/Login
  * Upload photos of clothing that will be kept as part of the user's profile
  * Tag uploaded items: add relevant tags to each piece
  * Select items of clothing by selecting relevant tags in order to view a list of items on the screen
  * Mix and match uploaded items in onscreen mirror as desired
  * Add new items to your digital wardrobe and also delete them

I think the UI could be improved, with more modern CSS.

In future, I would build a favourites system, so users could pick and unpick their favourite items. Also some AR/VR would be great - users could see themselves on the catwalk wearing potential outfits - no need to try on clothes again!


## Background:

I love shopping, and this app is a cure for me and others like me!

I was thinking, “What should I do for my CS50 final project? What should I do for my CS50 final project?!!”

I was thinking about the requirements: “All that we ask is that you build something of interest to you, that you solve an actual problem, that you impact your community, or that you change the world.”

I had just got back from the Geek Girl Meetup Summer Party and I decided that I wanted to do something for women. And that I wanted to do something frivolous and unnecessary. That is how the idea for MyWardrobe came about.

MyWardrobe is a digital wardrobe - a web application that allows you to mix and match clothes from your existing wardrobe to create new outfits. You can see these outfits in a virtual dressing room allowing you to see how things look before trying them on.

The user uploads photos of items of their clothing onto a database and attaches relevant tags to the photos. They can then select items of clothing by selecting relevant tags in order to view an array of items on the screen. They can then mix and match these items in the onscreen mirror as desired. In addition, the user can also add new items of clothing to their wardrobe and also delete items.

The user will also be able to print out outfits that they have created, post them to social media or save them in a file.

The advantages of using this app is that you no longer have to try on lots of clothes to see how they look on you. This can be tiring and even frustrating. The app will also show you what’s in your wardrobe so you don’t have to look through all the clothes or forget the hidden ones. 

I did some research on the web to see if anyone else had thought of this idea of a ‘digital wardrobe’, but all of the ones I saw on the Internet were for buying new clothes and not for users’ existing clothes. I also came across a clip from the film ‘Clueless’ (one of my favourite films) in which the main character ‘Cher’ is using a digital wardrobe, with some websites claiming this is now a reality. To be honest, MyWardrobe more like a digital dressing room. While trying to work out how the different rectangles of the photos would fit together, I remembered a game I had as a child called ‘Fashion Plates’. The idea of the game was to mix and match different rectangles which had drawings of clothes on them to create new outfits. I realised that MyWardrobe is a sort of digital version of that game. As you can see I had a childhood ambition to become a fashion designer - I used to make clothes for my Sindy doll with the help of my mum.

I saw the ‘Live, love, shine’ logo on a notebook in WHSmith and thought it was quite flaky and ridiculous. Therefore I decided to use it for my app. However, on a more serious note I believe my app will actually allow users to live, love and shine, by improving their self-confidence - they will become more creative and better dressed.

The app will allow users to see how they could wear their existing clothes in new and different ways and therefore maybe reducing the amount of new clothes they buy - this is eco-friendly. The user interface is designed to look like an online shopfront, so that the user will also have the ‘shopping’ experience. The app may also be useful to people who are disabled and find it difficult to try on clothes. The app will also allow users to be creative, by creating their own outfits.

Some of the technology that does not exist today could be used to improve the app in the future - especially virtual reality: users could be able to see themselves wearing the items and walking down a catwalk.

Going back to the requirements of the project, I now realise that I believe I have fulfilled them: I have an interest in fashion, I have solved the problem of trying on clothes, I believe my app will allow people to be creative, and I believe I have helped to save the planet.
